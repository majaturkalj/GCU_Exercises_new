# Software Development for Data Science from Glasgow Caledonian University
I have been attending this short online basic course in Python and Data Science.
There were two coursework throughout this course and both were utilized in Google Colab.

The first coursework was exploratory data analysis of the Ames Housing dataset. I used Numpy and Pandas for formatting the data, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis techniques to describe the data and data visualization.

The second coursework was about Convolutional Neural Networks. The task was to explore the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Image Classification.
